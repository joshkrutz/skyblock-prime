# Skyblock Prime
In my mind, the classic skyblock gamemode spawns a player on a barren island in the middle of the void with a tiny starter chest. From here, you were left to your own devices--limited by your creativity and items that weren't renewable.

Then came an update that added Challenges. These herculean tasks would reward the grind and offered a way to get non-renewable items. Huge! I love them. In my mind, that should have been it. Of course, rebalancing would be needed for challenges after significant Minecraft updates (such as moss's introduction that enabled renewable dirt). To my dismay, servers like these weren't common. Many added shops, kits, and server voting rewards (or worse loot boxes) that totally disrupt the meaning of Skyblock.

So this plugin exists to 1) pay hommage to those great developers before me; 2) test my patience; and most importantly 3) restore Skyblock sanctity with a plug-and-play Skyblock plugin.
